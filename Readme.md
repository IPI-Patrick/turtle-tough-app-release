    <b> Turtle Tough Sensor Management Software </b>
</h1>

The official software to read and manage all Turtle Tough digital pH sensors. 

# Installation:
To Install This software, simply download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/IPI-Patrick/turtle-tough-app-release/releases/tag/v0.1.19) and run the executable.

***Note:*** On windows a Windows Defender Smartscreen window may appear. If so, simply click "More Info" then "Run Anyway". This is simply an artifact of the digital signing process.

# Roadmap
- ## First Official Release
    - **Live Readings;** Ability to get and display live readings of multiple connected digital Turtle Tough pH sensors on a beautiful, easy to read dashboard.
    - Basic plotting of live sensor readings for easy diagnostics.
    - **Easy Connection;** Automatic connection to Turtle Tough Smart Sensor Communication Hub's with fast re-connection of previously connected Turtle Tough Sensors.
    - **Sensor Scanning;** Easily scan for newly connected sensors with unknown modbus addresses.
    - **Sensor Configuration;** Ability to configure sensors with their own unique name for easy identification.
    - Allows all sensor settings to be configured directly from the application.
    - **Sensor Calibration and Diagnostics;** Simple calibration of all Digital pH sensors with the ability to print calibration reports and remember the results of the last calibration. 
    - Sensor health score generated via a set of complex heuristics from the last completed calibration. 

- ## Version 1.x
  - Support for further Turtle Tough Digital Sensor Types.
  - Support for digital ORP, Conductivity and Dissolved Oxygen Sensors.
  - Add support for Mac and Linux operating systems.
  - Add support for multiple languages.

- ## Version 2.0 (Lab Version)
